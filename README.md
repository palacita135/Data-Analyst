# DATA ANALYST SALES

**Automated ETL & Dashboard for Indonesian Restaurant Sales Analysis.**

## Overview

This application automates the workflow for analyzing sales data from an Indonesian Resto/F&B business. It takes raw Excel/CSV data, cleans it (handling dates, currency, and strict types), and presents it in an interactive Web Dashboard with AI-powered insights.

## Features

- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Robust pipeline handles `DD/MM/YYYY` dates, currency symbols (`Rp`, `,`), and missing values.
- **Web Dashboard**: Visualizes sales trends (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), Top Selling Items, and Dining Options.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Ask questions like "What is the top selling item daily?" or "Predict revenue" to get instant answers.
- **Strict Reporting**: Ensures you only see data for the selected period (no misleading partial charts).

1.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r Python/requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Start the Application**:

    ```bash
    python Python/gui_app.py

3.  **Workflow**:
